# SPICED Academy Full Stack Web Development final project

At the end of the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp I had one week to realize a small project using frontend and backend techniques to show the knowledge what I acquired during the 13 week period.
I chose to create a simple and small online learning platform. The intention was to create this platform for musicians.

### Used technologies, frameworks:

-   React
-   Redux
-   Node.js
-   AWS S3 upload
-   PostgreSQL
-   CSS

### Workflow of the platform:

-   every user can create lessons
-   every user can submit their solution to other's lesson
-   when the user creates a lessons, there is the possibility to record audio with the microphone. This record is the part of the lessons. So, when a "student" starts a lesson, this recording can be listened (also with loop), and the student can practice with it.
-   Once the student has practiced enough, he or she can assign his solution, also with audio recording.
-   The creator of the lesson evaluates if the student's assignment/solution is correct
